*Digital Soil Mapping for Mount Kenya Region*

Welcome to the **Mount Kenya Digital Soil Map** repository! This project focuses on creating a digital soil map for the Mount Kenya region using machine learning techniques to predict Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) levels. The repository contains R scripts for data processing, model training, validation, and visualization of SOC distributions across different datasets.

## üåü Overview

This project aims to develop a digital soil map for the Mount Kenya region by predicting Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) levels using machine learning. The workflow includes:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing soil data for analysis.
- **Model Training:** Using cross-validation to train models on training and validation datasets.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance on test datasets.
- **Visualization:** Generating density plots and scatterplots to analyze SOC distributions and model predictions.

The scripts in this repository are written in R and utilize packages like `ggplot2` and `tune` for visualization and model evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run the scripts in this repository, you'll need to have R installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install R:**
   - Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. **Install RStudio (Optional):**
   - For a better development experience, install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

3. **Run the GEE script to get the covariates:**
   Open R or RStudio and run the scrips from the repo:

4. **Install Required R Packages:**
   Open R, preferably RStudio and run the scrips from the repo:
   
## üìä Data Description

The project uses four datasets to predict Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) levels in the Mount Kenya region:

- **Train-CV:** Combined training and validation data used in cross-validation (50 samples).
- **Validation:** Data for hyperparameter tuning (10 samples).
- **Test:** Data for final model evaluation (10 samples).
